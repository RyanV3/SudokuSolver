Simple program that solves a pre-determined sudoku board using the backtracking algorithm, along with a first attempt to make a GUI version. It currently only solves the 
single pre-loaded unsolved board, but I would like to update with a way to let the user select from several different boards. 

The GUI version solves the board correctly, but I would like to create a second version that is capable of showing the steps of the backtracking algorithm visually as it 
is solving the board.
